1) Files related to the simulation of the GHR-ICD using the CG forcefield Martini 3 (3.0.b.3.2) with different ammounts of scalling (increase) of the protein-water interactions (5 - 15%) both using unbiased and MetaDynamics (with Rg as CV) MD simulations. 
2) Files related to the fiting of GHR-ICD SAXS data using the theoretical scattering ontained from the backmapping to AA of conformtions obtained from the simulations mentioned in (1). 
3) Backmapped structures avaliable at: 10.5281/zenodo.4740700
