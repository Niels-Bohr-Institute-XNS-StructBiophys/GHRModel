# GHR repository
Data and supporting files for: "Order and disorder â€“ an integrative structure of the full-length human growth hormone receptor" by Kassem, Araya-Secchi et al.

Include here are:
- The input and start files for the reported modeling and simulations of: hGHR-ICD and hGHRfl-GFP. 
- Input files and models obtained for GHR-ECD (Rosetta Floppy-Tail), GHR-ECD-TMD (Rosetta Domain-Assembly).
- Scripts used in the analysis of simulation data and SAXS Fits.
- Fits between the SAXS data and theoretical scattering from structures of GHR-ECD, GHR-ICD and GHRfl-GFP obtained from modeling and simulations as reported in the manuscript. 

- Simulation trajectories are avaliable at:10.5281/zenodo.4737501
- Models of GHR-ECD and GHR-ECD+TMD, backmapped structures from CG simulations (GHR-ICD and GHRfl-GFP) and WillItFit SAXS Fits for hGHRfl-GFP avaliable at:10.5281/zenodo.4740700
