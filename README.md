# GHR repository
Data and supporting files for: "Order and disorder â€“ an integrative structure of the full-length human growth hormone receptor" by Kassem, Araya-Secchi et al.

Include here are:
1) The input and start files for the reported modeling and simulations of: hGHR-ICD and hGHRfl-GFP. 
2) Scripts used in the analysis of simulation data and SAXS Fits.
3) Fits between the SAXS data and theoretical scattering from structures of GHR-ECD, GHR-ICD and GHRfl-GFP obtained from modeling and simulations as reported in the manuscript. 

Simulation trajectories are avaliable at:10.5281/zenodo.4737501
Models of GHR-ECD and GHR-ECD+TMD, backmapped structures from CG simulations (GHR-ICD and GHRfl-GFP) and WillItFit SAXS Fits for hGHRfl avaliable at:10.5281/zenodo.4740700
